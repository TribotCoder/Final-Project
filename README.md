Hello Dr. Shashi,
welcome to our GitHub repo, here is our final [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_nRuhoh6r3RBLV-rpJe1oftLOYrEbs2ZTyod7Enzeg/edit?tab=t.0). Here are our [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-LNVOBgYm1o5F6YCMmfS2xQ0db0iOf4xnP2t1I-_H30/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p). Our database is the CSV file starting with "StormEvents_details". Our jupyter notebook is titled "cap4770_mysql.ipynb". There is a second jupyter notebook titled "cap47770_db_validator.ipynb" that checks to make sure that the CSV is correctly loaded into your SQL server database. All of our statements detailing our contributions and what we learned are in the naming convention of "FirstNameLastNameStatement". The "FinalProjectVoiceover" is our presentation of the slides.
